## Usage

Pantreats is a tool for discovering what recipes you can make with just the ingredients in your pantry.

#### Pantry Setup

First, you'll want to set up your Pantreats pantry to contain any ingredients items in your kitchen.

These can be any type of ingredient, like eggs, bread, condensed milk, or cumin. Anything significant can and should be added for a more complete experience.

Note:
* You can leave out some of the more basic ingredients, like water and salt.
* Quantities are never taken into account. You either have the ingredient or you don't.
* Your pantry is only permanent if you create a Pantreats account.

#### Browsing Recipes

Once you've set up your pantry, there's little work to be done.

Simply return to the Pantreats home page, which will now be populated with all of the delicacies you can immediately begin to make.

If you'd like to contribute to the community by submitting your own recipe, you must first be signed in.

Simply click the "Submit a Recipe" button on the upper navigation bar to get started.

Here, you will fill out the recipe name, ingredients, steps to cook, as well as some other optional details.
